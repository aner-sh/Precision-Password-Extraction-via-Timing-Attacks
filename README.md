# Precision-Password-Extraction-via-Timing-Attacks
This Python script performs statistical inference on HTTP response delays to deduce password characters in a timing attack scenario. By measuring and analyzing the response time of a remote server over multiple request cycles, it identifies the most probable character at each password position based on timing anomalies.
